# Advent of Code 2025
These are my scripts for the puzzles at https://adventofcode.com/2025 . Same as the previous years, I will be uploading all days that I solve with a short commentary on thought process/description. All the puzzles (so far) have been solved without looking up any hint related to the event. Note that my naming process for the input texts is input + the date. So for the first day it was input1.txt, the second day input2.txt... etc.

## Day 1
Again, the first days are generally easy, so I didn't expect much. Part 1 was about keeping track of a position, using a little modular arithmetic. Part 2 just needed to calculate the number of turns as well after each command, with some caution for edge cases to not double count or miscount.

## Day 2
Day 2 was fairly easy too. In fact I misread the prompt and did wrote the code for part 2 before I finished part 1. Part 1 was basically about splitting the words in half and seeing if those halves match. In part 2, I reinvented the wheel and wrote a function to find the divisors of numbers instead of grabbing a ready made one. Then checked the "sub-strings" of length corresponding to divisors of the length of the full string to see if the full string is made out of copies of those sub-strings. Small note for edge cases where the full string was of length "1". 

## Day 3
Day 3 didn't have anything special either. For part 1, you needed to find the largest concatenation of 2 digits inside a multi digit string. You just had to realize that you need to search the entire string minus the last character to find the first digit, and then from the first digit to the end to find the second digit. For part 2, you had to find the largest concatenation of 12 digits this time. The logic was the same though, you search the entire string minus the last 11 characters for the first digit, then from the first digit up until 10 characters before the end for the second digit, and so on...

## Day 4
Day 4 was quite easy as well. In part 1, we had a grid of "." and "@" characters and we had to check the surrounding block of all "@" characters to see how many of them were also the character "@" and count it if it's less than 4. For part 2, we just had to remove all the characters that met the previous condition and repeat until there are no more characters to remove.

## Day 5
Day 5 was the first day to have an interesting part. Part 1 was easy as well, we just had to figure out how many numbers within a set are inside a set of ranges. Part 2 was more tricky. We to find how many numbers in total were in that set of ranges. For this you have to take care of edge cases like a range within another range, a range half within another, a range encompassing two or more ranges... The way I did it was I sorted the ranges based on their start value and then progressively added more ranges to my set with a set of conditions, if the new range was entirely within the previous range then I ignored it, if the start of the new range was less then the end of the previous range (and the end of the new was greater than the end of the previous) then I adjust the end of the previous range to match the end of the new range... otherwise, I just appended the new range. This takes care of all edge cases.
